      <h5>MY PROJECT IDEA</h5>
      <p> A friend of mine had been discussing with me one afternoon how there were so many fitness apps that his clients had previously used, but none that he could vouch for as they were unable to tailor around his style of training. To this day he
        continues to use google sheets to create his clientâ€™s programs along with many other trainers that work alongside him. The project I am wanting to develop will be able to change this by offering a mobile application for all
        different types of fitness enthusiasts. The application will be user friendly yet multi-functional, so it is able to provide a vast variety of options for programming workouts for all different types of gyms, trainers, and clients.</p>
      <p>This project would be useful to many individuals in the fitness industry as there is a lack of fitness applications out there offering a connection between trainers and their clients. The applications that are available in the industry are all reliant on strict self-motivation or the personal trainer having control over whether you can access this
        software. I believe that allowing both the trainer and the client to have control over their profiles provides a unique point of difference to other apps currently available and will help customers feel as though they have more control over
        their own fitness journey.</p>
      <p>FitRite will be a mobile application using a modern user-interface to provide customers full control over their fitness programming and interaction with personal trainers and gyms. The user will be able to set up an account through the app
        whether they are the personal trainer or a client. The app will include a variety of different features to enable the user to have one fully integrated app for booking, programming, fitness tracking and results rather than having to use
        multiple different platforms. As the client can set up and access their own profile, they will be able to then allow access to a trainer or gym when they find the right one. </p>
      <h5>FEATURES</h5>

      <dl>
      <dt>Trainer and Client Profiles:</dt>
        <dd>Trainers and Clients can set up their own profiles to include as much information as they find necessary. The client can then share this information with other parties if they require.</dd>
        <dt>Fitness Regimen Selection:</dt>
        <dd>Enables trainers to select your fitness regimen type (e.g. CrossFit, Powerlifting, Bootcamp, or Training Gym). This will allow the trainer to adjust the types of programming templates and layouts that work best for the fitness type. </dd>
        <dt>Program Template Building:</dt>
        <dd>Create your programming template around your training style. This will allow you to make a program for small to large groups or individuals. This will allow you to create a tailored program and select a program duration e.g. 6-week
          powerlifting program.</dd>
      <dt>Client Detail Submissions:</dt>
        <dd>Clients will be able to answer questionnaires that trainer requests for assisting with obtaining weight, height, client goals and diet. This will help to assist with more tailored programming and weight-lifting calculations.</dd>
        <dt>Client and Trainer Discussion:</dt>
        <dd>Clients can make comments and changes to their daily programs so that they are able to document any changes that were made during their workout. The trainer can review the clients input and make further comments or adjust the following
          days programming if necessary. The client will also be able to upload videos to that workout day so that the trainer can review and comment for a more in-depth training experience between one-on-one or group sessions.</dd>
        <dt>Integrated Booking System:</dt>
        <dd>Clients will be able to make booking requests for training sessions whether they be group or one-on-one. The trainer will also be able to send the client requests to attend a session.</dd>
        <dt>Multiple-Gym Integration:</dt>
        <dd> Allows the client to share access to their profile with multiple gyms/trainers. This gives the client freedom to change facilities when needed or attend multiple training gyms/programs.</dd>
        <dt>Results Tracking:</dt>
        <dd>Clients will be able to track their fitness goals, personal bests and update relevant measurements and weight information. If the trainer requires any of this information to help with their programming, they will also be able to send
          push-requests to your app or phone number.</dd>
        <dt>Push Notifications:</dt>
        <dd>Push notifications and requests will allow both the trainer and client to keep updated with any changes and requests made from either party. This will also the client and trainer to receive notifications about their upcoming training
          sessions, events, and news.</dd>
        <dt>Competitive Fitness Statistics:</dt>
        <dd>For different types of fitness regimen and styles such as CrossFit, Powerlifting and Olympic lifting, keeping track of results from competitions is a large part of client and trainer motivation. The app will give the client and trainer
          the ability to review and update their competition results and maintain a statistics board.</dd>
        <dt>Notification Options:</dt>
        <dd>Personal trainers will have the flexibility to choose whether they would like to message their client using there provided phone number or message over the application using the chat option. This will mean the trainer has better reach to
          their customers as they will be able to maintain a database, especially if some clients choose not to use the app frequently.</dd>


      <h5>TOOLS AND SKILLS</h5>
      <p>The tools required to aid in the creation of this app include the use of a mobile app framework. Frameworks such as Ionic, NativeScript and React Native are all good frameworks to use as they are built to support both Android and IOS.
        These open-source frameworks generally require the use of programming languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Alongside having a good understanding of these languages, an understanding of user-interface design for mobile app
        development would be required. Further to this, I believe it is also important to have a solid understanding of the different types of fitness available and how they run their fitness programs. This may mean going to specific gyms and
        meeting with trainers to discuss what kind of templates and workouts they would need to use this app effectively. With all the tools available and with a good understanding of web programming, this project is achievable with time and
        determination.</p>
      <p>
        Overall, this app could be a groundbreaking addition to the fitness industry for those who are looking to integrate their apps and take control over all aspects of their fitness, whether they be a trainer or a client. I also believe that
        enabling the clients to get assistance between personal training sessions using direct communication and videos will help avoid unnecessary injuries that may occur when the communication is not being made. The fitness industry only
        continues to grow and that is why I believe that with providing the right integrated software, it would help save time and money for those who are wanting to have ease in their fitness management.
