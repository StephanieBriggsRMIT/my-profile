      <h5>MY IDEAL JOB</h5>
      <p>The job I have chosen as an ideal role for me is a Software Engineer C++ with EA. The role involves the programming of games using the languages C++ and Lua. This role really stood out to me as it covers a range of different areas that I am
        very interested in learning over the course of my degree including; 3D graphics, programming languages, mobile application development and of course being involved with games. EA specifically stood out to me as I have spent a lot of hours in
        the past playing the likes of The Sims and Need for Speed, so being able to contribute to their team is a bit of a dream of mine.</p>
      <p>Within this role it requires quite a bit of industry experience (7-9 years), specifically in software engineering within gaming. Further to the experience needed, the role requires strong skills in C++ along with skills in programming
        within gaming; include 3D graphics, user interface and special effects. These skills I believe would be obtained from both studying and from working within the industry. Though I have not had experience within the industry yet, I believe with
        the current subjects available within my degree I will be able to obtain the relevant programming and user-interface knowledge that can only push me in the right direction. A certain level of extra study and work will also be required outside
        of university, especially regarding improving my programming skills. This will help to put my best foot forward and gain the extra knowledge along the way to better understand programming for mobile device applications.</p>
      <p>The skills I currently have are centred mostly around design, but these skills would help me to better grasp the creative and graphic elements of this role. Along with these skills, I have a strong ability to quickly pick up new software,
        especially software that is graphic related. This I have obtained from my extensive experience working with software like Adobe Creative Cloud. When these skills are implemented in combination with my studies, they will only help allow me
        to further understand the 3D graphic and user interface elements of the position. To further my knowledge in graphics and special effects, some time spent exploring game engines such as Unity would be advantageous to gain the
        extra knowledge around a game development environment.</p>
      <p> In conclusion, there will be quite a few steps that I will need to take over the coming years to reach this goal, but with the extra hours of time put in to understand game development and programming in combination with
        the knowledge I obtain over this degree, I will be taking the right steps to achieve this goal. After finishing my degree, I believe the most practical course of action would be to aim for a junior developer position at EA and progress within
        the company to eventually move into this type of position.</p>
