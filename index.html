      <h5>ABOUT ME</h5>
      <p>My name is Steph and I grew up on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria. I was born in Australia and everyone as far back as my great-great-grandparents have been born here. My ancestors mostly originated from Europe with a mixture of Irish,
        English and German.</p>
      <p>As a child I went to a mixture of different primary schools in the south-east side of Melbourne, but eventually I finished my schooling at Frankston High School. During high school I took an interest in fashion design, so I decided to study
        it as a VET subject during my VCE studies. Upon finishing VCE and exploring a few different universities, I was finally led to the Associate Degree of Fashion Design and Technology at RMIT. My studies continued through to the Bachelor of
        Fashion (Design Technology) which I received after completing the additional third year in 2015.</p>
      <p>Over the past couple of years, I have started to gain an interest in certain sports after never really being involved in any sports as a child. This has been a very interesting experience for me so far as there is an element of fear as an
        adult, but I am starting to really enjoy the adrenaline rush that comes with skateboarding and snowboarding. I like to think that with every new hobby or experience that you try, there will always be an element of fear or risk, but with time
        and persistence it will eventuate into a positive experience that you can take pride in.</p>
      <h6> INTEREST IN IT</h6>
      <p>My love for IT started when I was quite young as I always enjoyed trying to figure out how computers worked and used them as a tool for problem-solving. When I was in my early teens, I enjoyed building my own websites using basic HTML and
        would include chat widgets on them so I can talk to my classmates at school. Over the years I would find that my friends and family would always come to me for help when it came to technology related problems as I was always pushing to
        resolve the issue and was persistence until I found the solution.</p>
      <p>The reason I chose to study this course through RMIT is due to having previously studied fashion design with them and knowing that the course had covered so many areas of the industry that other courses could not provide. While I was
        studying, I found RMIT to have such a wide range of resources and all the teachers were very hands on and they were able to provide one-on-one help where required. I found it to be an easy decision to choose RMIT when I was looking into the
        Information Technology courses available through Open University.</p>
      <p>Throughout my studies I expect to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals in a range of different areas within IT that are yet to be explored. Further to this I hope to gain a better understanding of the other
        programming languages out there and their applications. Some other areas I am wanting to learn more about are cloud technology, user-centered design, and web development. I would like to gain a broader understanding in these areas and
        eventually move into a position where I can apply this knowledge.</p>
